# Couch
Stackathon

Couch is a voting app designed to help groups of people decide what to watch for movie night.  A host user can set up a "couch" and invite all their friends.  The host user selects which streaming services they have and what genres of movie they are interested in watching.  Couch queries for the 50 currently most popular movies on those services and sets up a swipe-based voting system for the group. Once users have all swiped, they will see the movie they are watching tonight, with description and link to the trailer.
